# 📚 Inventory Control System 📚

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Inventory Control System is an easy-to-use program for managing your store's inventory. This system allows you to track your products, sales, and profits with ease. It helps store owners keep their stock in check and make informed decisions about restocking and pricing.

## 💡 Key Features:

- **View Inventory:** Quickly view all products with their details including name, ID, quantity, and cost.
- **Record Sales:** Log sales for products and automatically update stock and profit.
- **Calculate Profit:** View the profit for each item sold and the overall profit for the store.
- **Restock Items:** Easily add more stock for existing products.
- **Add New Items:** Add new products to your inventory if space allows.
- **Save/Load Data:** The program supports saving inventory data to a file and loading it when you start the program.

## ⚙️ How It Works:

- **Menu Options:** The program has a simple menu system that lets you choose from various options like viewing inventory, recording sales, and more.
- **Item Details:** Each item in the inventory is identified by a unique ID and contains data such as stock quantity, cost, units sold, and profit.
- **Data Persistence:** All inventory data is saved in a text file (`AddDatatoStock.txt`), ensuring your data is not lost when the program closes.
